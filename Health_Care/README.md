## Documentation

In this prototype, we have two main classes: VitalSigns and HealthMonitor. The VitalSigns class represents a specific vital sign (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature) with its name and current value. The HealthMonitor class manages the vital signs and periodically generates random readings using a Timer and TimerTask.

To use the prototype, you can create an instance of HealthMonitor, add the vital signs you want to monitor using the addVitalSign() method, and then start the monitoring process using the startMonitoring() method. The program will display the current readings of each vital sign every 5 seconds and check for abnormal values, triggering alerts if necessary.

Again, please note that this is a basic working prototype, and in a real-world application, you would need to consider additional features such as data storage, user interfaces, and more sophisticated algorithms for analyzing vital signs.
